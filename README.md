# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Arduino battery management system for lead acid car batteries. This will take in the voltage and determine if it is below a threshhold and then open a switch to terminate the connection to the car, preserving just enough voltage to start the car. The user will then press the reset button on the arduino and the switch will close allowing the user to start the car and charge the battery.   



## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

TODO

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Arduino is written in C and I am also doing this project for my capstone project. Is that okay?
