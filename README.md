Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have gotten the set up code written out and the serial monitor working and taking in accuaate voltage from the battery. additionally i decided to use 11.3 volts as a cutoff threshold based on testing.  

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

the void loop has not been started 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

the logic and functions in C that need to be used to ensure that if the voltage drops down for less than 5 seconds and comes back up it will not open the switch. But if the voltage stays below 11.3 v it will open the switch.
